Pattern Memory Game - Detailed Project Document
1. Game Overview

    Title: Memory Echo
    Genre: Pattern memory/rhythm game
    Target Platform: PC (primary), Web (HTML5 export), Mobile (Android/iOS)
    Core Gameplay: Players observe sequences of colored lights with corresponding sounds, then replicate the exact pattern by clicking buttons in the correct order
    Inspiration: Classic Simon electronic game with modern enhancements

2. Core Features
2.1 Essential Gameplay Elements

    Pattern System:
        Start with 1-step sequences, increase by 1 each round
        Maximum sequence length: 20 steps (configurable)
        Random pattern generation with no repeating consecutive elements
    Visual Feedback:
        4-6 colored buttons (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple, Orange)
        Button highlight duration: 600ms
        Inter-step delay: 400ms
        Visual button press feedback with scaling animation
    Audio System:
        Unique tone for each color (different frequencies: 261Hz, 329Hz, 392Hz, 523Hz, 659Hz, 784Hz)
        Sound duration: 500ms with 100ms fade-out
        Optional background music during gameplay
    Input Validation:
        Real-time feedback on correct/incorrect inputs
        Game over on first mistake
        Visual indication of current position in sequence

2.2 Progression & Scoring

    Score Calculation:
        Base points per correct step: 10
        Multiplier increases with sequence length: score += step_number * 10 * round_number
        Bonus points for perfect rounds: +50
    Difficulty Progression:
        Rounds 1-5: Normal speed (600ms highlights)
        Rounds 6-10: Fast speed (400ms highlights)
        Rounds 11+: Very fast speed (300ms highlights)
    Lives System: 3 lives, lose one per mistake, game over when all lives lost

2.3 Optional Advanced Features

    AI-Powered Adaptive Difficulty: Adjust timing based on player performance
    Pattern Analysis: AI suggests optimal memorization strategies
    Procedural Audio: AI-generated unique tones for each session
    Smart Hints: Context-aware assistance for struggling players

3. Technical Requirements
